# JWabbit 

This is a Java port of the "Wabbitemu" TI calculator emulator.  It does not implement all the features in wabbitemu, but functions as a working calculator.

To use this legally, you need to own a TI calculator for each instance of the emulator you run.

The main class is "jwabbit.Launcher", which will prompt for the calculator ROM file.
